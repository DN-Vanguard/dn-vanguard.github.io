            <p>
            Hi there! My name is Domiltan Nguyen, but everyone calls me Dom!
            A little about me, I was born and raised in Seattle, WA, I like listening to kpop, playing tennis, and watching anime!
            I also graduated from the University of Washington with Bachelors in Marketing and IS in Spring of 2020!
            <br><br>
            Many of asked why I joined a coding bootcamp so soon after graduating from college. "You should've had a plan after working so hard
            towards 2 degrees", "Just apply to other jobs, you're still young so you'll be fine" is what I heard a lot... Truthfully speaking,
            I was not happy with my current job or field of work in marketing. I wanted to do more with my technical background. After doing some research and reflecting
            on my IS coursework from college, I realized that I genuinely enjoyed coding. Back then, my courses in coding was something I did for fun 
            and to grasp a better understanding of, but I never took the time to pursue it as a career and solely focused on a marketing career.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Upon recieving hundreds of rejection emails from various coding/IS related positions, I realized that I lacked experience,
            and my college coursework was either not enough or applicable to what the companies were looking for. I needed to find a way to
            get hands-on experience, and after days of researching, I stumbled upon UW's Coding Bootcamp. It was exactly what I was looking for,
            and after reaching out to UW Coding Bootcamp alums, they were very informative, kind, and successful in their new careers! 
            Knowing myself, if I put in the work in this bootcamp, it would pay off in the long run, so here I am.
            <br><br>
            My message to everyone is that it is NEVER too late to figure out what you want in life. It is your life, so take charge and don't live with regrets.
            </p>
