            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                Hi there! My name is Domiltan Nguyen, but everyone calls me Dom!
                A little about me, I was born and raised in Seattle, WA, I like listening to kpop, playing tennis, and watching anime!
                I also graduated from the University of Washington with Bachelors in Marketing and IS in Spring of 2020!
                </p>
                <p>
                After several months of working a marketing job I did not enjoy, I decided to focus on my other degree. However,
                upon recieving hundreds of rejection emails from various IS related positions, I realized that I lacked experience,
                and my college coursework was either not enough or applicable to what the companies were looking for. I wanted to find a way to
                get hands-on experience, and after days of researching, I stumbled upon UW's Coding Bootcamp. 
                After reaching out to UW Coding Bootcamp alums, I learned how remarkable and successful they became after graduating from the bootcamp.
                Knowing myself, if I put in the work in this bootcamp, it would pay off in the long run, so here I am!
                </p>
                <p>
                It is NEVER too late to figure out what you want in life. It is your life, so take charge and don't live with regrets.
                </p>
