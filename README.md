## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## What was your motivation?
- I saw that many web developers show off their work through an online portfolio of some kind.
- This made me realize that in order to succeed in this field, I need to focus and build things that people would want to hire me for.

## Why did I build this project?
- Similar to my motivation, I wanted to stand out, and show the public the materials I have worked on from raw code and what I have learned so far.
